**WHY THIS?**

In this period of COVID teachers especially those who are not usual to the online teaching platforms are facing many problems which can be solved through a chatbot that can answer their each and every query.


**STARTING(JUST A LOOK):**

1. Choose the platform: 
          ZOOM ||  GOOGLE MEET || GOOGLE CLASSROOM || MICROSOFT TEAMS (these will be  buttons user will not enter these as there is a chance for mismatch of strings)

2. Students are misbehaving, don't worry :)
MUTE THE STUDENT || REMOVE THE STUDENT.


**WORKING:**

- Assisting how to take classes,

- how to generate link, sending link to students via mail or whatsapp,

- how to admit or deny entry to a participant, how to mute/remove a participant,

- when to switch on video and when to keep it off, how to present screen,

- if someone has stylus/graphic tablet how to use it with screen sharing and writing on the screen,

- how to end meeting,

- how to take tests and assignments using meet and google forms and other free platforms. 


**FUTURE WORK:**

Application that will automatically mark attendance of a student.


In many cases students just join to get attendance and then they leave, so for that the attendance will be recorded 2-3 times.

1. If a student is not connected to the meeting at all the three moments, he/she will be marked ABSENT.

2. The students which will be there all the three times will be marked PRESENT.

3. Those which were present partially can be MANUALLY OVERWRITTEN by the teacher whether to give them present or absent, because in some cases children go out of network due to genuine issues so the teacher must give them full attendance.
